Floating login/ register element that sticks to the top of the screen and changes depending on user login state.

== Description ==

A really simple to use plugin that will create a floating element that either displays login/ register or logout/profile, depending on whether the user is logged in. Fully customisable colors, links and properties.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `floating-login.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
3. Customise though the floating login panel under settings in your admin area

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The element doesn't show up anywhere on the front-end. =

Try changing the z-index of the element so that it isn't showing up below something else. If that doesn't work then disable all plugins and revert back to the default theme to see if there is a conflict.
